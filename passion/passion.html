     <h3 class="ft88">style/art direction </h3> 
        <p>compared to the many other zelda games, skyward sword takes on a more impressionist style with its graphics and art direction in general. i personally really enjoy the many painterly textures that this game has to offer and love to stare at all its tiny details. the style also strikes a nice balance between the darker, more realistic visuals of twilight princess and the more cartoonish, playful style of wind waker that allows for the game to be tonally flexible. the colors are also very pretty and nice and awesome sauce yay <br> 
        i also really enjoy the character designs in this game. they similarly strike a nice balance between semi-realism and fun cartoony guys; the game is both quite beautiful but also has a lot of personality <br> also one of the characters who works at a pumpkin themed restaurant has pumpkin shaped hair and i think that’s really cool </p>

    <h3 class="ft88">story/lore</h3> 
        <p>i made a google slides presentation on this once and i don’t feel like doing it again but the lore is awesome you should look it up (or play the game :D) just trust </p>

    <h3 class="ft88">soundtrack</h3> 
        <p>skyward sword has probably one of my favorite soundtracks in the series. i got to play a medley of a bunch of different songs for my piano recital one year and it was a lot of fun to play. the music is very expressive and well-arranged; i would love to hear it in an orchestra setting one day. the skyloft theme makes me smile really big </p>

    <h3 class="ft88">the shitty controls…</h3> 
        <p>if you have heard of or played the original wii version of skyward sword before, you have probably heard many times about how much the motion controls suck balls. they are very finicky with how you swing the wii remote which can definitely become annoying for people since a lot of the gameplay mechanics (items, puzzles, combat, doing random shit, etc.) are motion-based in the sense that accuracy of direction matters. this has definitely caused a lot of people to rage at the game and is one of the reasons why i don’t try to fight people when they say they don’t like the game <br>
        that being said, i recently beat skyward hd (nintendo switch remake), and while the hd remake of the game had a much smoother control scheme, one kinda(?) negative result of this change is that the game is easy as hell now. weirdly enough, i kinda missed the feeling having to take multiple tries to clear a puzzle or a boss fight. maybe i am attached to the rage that the original version created for nostalgia reasons or something idk <br> 
        i also find the fact that it sucks a little charming ok. sue me 
        <br> they also didn’t bother me too much personally so maybe to some extent i was just good at the game :D upon starting a new playthrough of the wii version though i realized that the motion controls end up being a lot more accurate if you swing the wii remote fully like a sword (like in bigger sweeping motions) rather than just flicking the wii remote in the direction you want the sword to go 
        <br> i think the goal of the motion controls was likely to create a more immersive experience but it unfortunately fell flat on the fact that most people are probably going to just be playing this game sitting on their couch rather than an active sword swinging mode lol </p>
