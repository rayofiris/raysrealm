            <h4>My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be? <br> by Laurel Schwulst<br><br> and <br><br> A Rant About "Technology"<br> by Ursula K. Le Guin</h4>
            <p>this is a fun coincidence. in my last graphic design project (which involved republishing texts of our choosing) i actually used the first reading as one of the excerpts for <a href="https://rayofiris.neocities.org/fruitsofahandmadeweb">my publication,</a> specifically the “website as plant” and “website as garden” section. now that i’m a working college student with little time to play around or even think about the idea of playing like i used to, making amateur little websites has been the closest feeling i can get to being back in my backyard making small houses out of sticks and leaves. i think that my website is like a loosely patched-together bag, with each of its pages making up the many second-hand charms scattered across it. i find the novelty of the patched-together “old web” (or just handmade web since i was not an active part of that time) far more intriguing and endearing than the shiny, manufactured plastic bag that is social media and would much rather bare my soul to the former, much more comforting space. <br><br>
            on another note the birds are cool as fuck i like them. i should add talking guys to my website sometime. <br><br>
            i think my favorite piece of technology is the piano. i like the piano. while not the same, the feeling of coding isn’t too far off; they’re both great outlets for expression. </p>
